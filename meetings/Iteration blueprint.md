Hello everyone this is the blueprint you must follow in order to develop each iteration, on this case is about iteration 2 but you can change it to your iteration number. Please at the start of an iteration (e.g. Iteration 2 requirements) there is this big chunk of text (Person's name | Day | Begin time | End time | Duration (end - start time) | phase + iteration) this is to know who and when a person is working, to match the expected time. As you know you have to develop both the diagrams (use case, static view and class) of the functional requirement/use case you have to implement and please do not include this part on the final commit, thanks.

# Iteration 2

Made by:
  - Person 1
  - Person 2

## Iteration 2 requirements
**Person's name | Day | Begin time | End time | Duration (end - start time) | phase + iteration (design iteration 2)**
On this itereation we have to develop the **use case 19**: *create, update, and delete bibliographic records.* In order to do this we designed the
use case diagrams for both the client and the server.

### Client's requirements analysis

Basically what we have to do here is one of those green boxes saying things about this requirement

### Server's requirements analysis

Basically what we have to do here is one of those green boxes saying things about this requirement

### Client use case diagram

**Client's use case diagram**

### Server use case diagram

**Server's use case diagram**

### Basic workflow

### Client's basic workflow

**Basically describe in simple steps how our system will behave normally, with no errors or weird things happening, starting from the interaction of the user ending with the return from the system**

### Server's basic workflow

**Basically describe in simple steps how our system will behave normally, with no errors or weird things happening, starting from the interaction of the user ending with the return from the system**

## Iteration 2 analysis
**Person's name | Day | Begin time | End time | Duration (end - start time) | phase + iteration (analysis iteration 2)**
On this phase we developed the static view of the class diagram for both the client and the server

### Client static's view diagram

**Client static's view diagram**

### Server static's view diagram

**Server static's view diagram**

## Iteration 2 design
**Person's name | Day | Begin time | End time | Duration (end - start time) | phase + iteration (design iteration 2)**
On this phase we developed the class diagram for both the client and the server

### Client's class diagram

**Client's class diagram**

### Server's class diagram

**Server's class diagram**

## Iteration 2 implementation
**Person's name | Day | Begin time | End time | Duration (end - start time) | phase + iteration (implementation iteration 2)**
On this phase forward engineered our diagrams in order to develop the code

### Client's application

**Screenshot of the .java files of the client**

### Server's application

**Screenshot of the .java files of the server**

## Iteration 2 testing
**Person's name | Day | Begin time | End time | Duration (end - start time) | phase + iteration (testing iteration 2)**
On this phase tested the perviously inplemented code and we made sure it passed all the tests

### Client's tests

### Server's tests
