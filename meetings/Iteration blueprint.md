Hello everyone this is the blueprint you must follow in order to develop each iteration, on this case is about iteration 2 but you can change it to your iteration number. As you know you have to develop both the diagrams (use case, static view and class) of the functional requirement/use case you have to implement and please do not include this part on the final commit, thanks.

## Iteration 2 requirements
# Person's name | Day | Begin time | End time | Duration (end - start time) | phase + iteration (design iteration 2)
On this itereation we have to develop the **use case 19**: *create, update, and delete bibliographic records.* In order to do this we designed the
use case diagrams for both the client and the server.

### Client use case diagram

# Client's use case diagram

### Server use case diagram

# Server's use case diagram

### Basic workflow

# Esto lo ponemos o no?

## Iteration 2 analysis
# Person's name | Day | Begin time | End time | Duration (end - start time) | phase + iteration (analysis iteration 2)
On this phase we developed the static view of the class diagram for both the client and the server

### Client static's view diagram

# Client static's view diagram

### Server static's view diagram

# Server static's view diagram

## Iteration 2 design
# Person's name | Day | Begin time | End time | Duration (end - start time) | phase + iteration (design iteration 2)
On this phase we developed the class diagram for both the client and the server

### Client's class diagram

# Client's class diagram

### Server's class diagram

# Server's class diagram

## Iteration 2 implementation
# Person's name | Day | Begin time | End time | Duration (end - start time) | phase + iteration (implementation iteration 2)
On this phase forward engineered our diagrams in order to develop the code

### Client's application

# Screenshot of the .java files of the client

### Server's application

# Screenshot of the .java files of the server

## Iteration 2 testing
# Person's name | Day | Begin time | End time | Duration (end - start time) | phase + iteration (testing iteration 2)
On this phase tested the perviously inplemented code and we made sure it passed all the tests

### Client's tests

# Screenshot of the .java files of the client

### Server's tests

# Screenshot of the .java files of the server
