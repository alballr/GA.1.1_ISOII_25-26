Assistance → Everybody was present (Alvaro arrived 6 minutes late, but joined the session shortly after it began).

At the beginning of the meeting, we talked about several GitHub-related questions that some team members had, especially those who had never used GitHub before and were still getting familiar with its main functions such as committing, pushing, and creating branches. The discussion helped clarify some common doubts and ensured that everyone understood the basic workflow for collaborating through GitHub.

The group leader then took the opportunity to remind everyone about how to correctly set and record the working hours for the project. Alvaro had a doubt about this process, but it was resolved quickly with the help of the team leader, ensuring that everyone knew exactly how to track and report their time contributions accurately.

Additionally, the group leader emphasized once again the correct procedure for closing issues on GitHub, explaining that each issue should be properly documented, assigned, and closed only once the corresponding task has been fully completed and reviewed. This was to maintain a clean and organized repository.

Later, the team communicated with another group to request access to their GitHub repository, and they granted it successfully, allowing for smoother coordination between both groups and better visibility of each other’s work.

Afterward, the Iteration 1 group was reviewed, and they were praised for doing an excellent job. However, it was noted that this group had created six different requirements analyses, when typically only one is expected, which was mentioned as something to be adjusted in the future.

Next, the Iteration 2 group was discussed. They were asked to make some corrections to their wiki page, as it needed improvement in structure and presentation. Nevertheless, it was acknowledged that their diagrams were properly done and technically correct.

The Iteration 3 group was also reviewed, and they too were recognized for their excellent work, showing consistent progress and good organization throughout their iteration.

In the final part of the session, some time was devoted to discussing the theoretical aspects of the project, reviewing key concepts that will be relevant for the next development phase.

TO DO for next week

Clean up the branches in GitHub to ensure that only relevant and up-to-date ones remain.

Ask Ismael the remaining doubts about pull requests and clarify how to perform merges correctly to avoid conflicts.

Create subcategories in the GitHub repository to better organize each phase of the project: Inception, Elaboration, and Construction.

Finally, before ending the session, nobody had any further complaints, demands, or doubts, and everyone agreed on the tasks to be done for the next week.
